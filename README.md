# Shout Motion: 100DaysOfCode

This project was created for educational purposes, being a refactor of an old project developed as my final grade in my bachelor of technology degree. Now it is also my inspiration for the #100daysOfCode challenge.

You can find more information about the challenge [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

The goal of my 100DaysOfCode is to learn some new technologies, as I already code daily in my job, I want to try new things. 

More specifically:

- Google Firebase;
- Material UI 5.0 (alpha stage);
- React-Router 6.0 (beta stage);
- A new state management lib (No Redux. Still thinking about options, but Recoil sounds promising. Using Context API for now);
- More stuff that I might be interested down the line...
